    "Ans. Deadlocks are like freezing conditions which occur in situations where a shared resource is acquired and not released. And a thread waits for a condition which never occurs, this results in freezing of program.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the example of deadlock provided below, when the thread t1 acquires a lock and doesn't realease it, this causes in freezing of program and thread t2 can never start. This is deadlock condition.\n",
